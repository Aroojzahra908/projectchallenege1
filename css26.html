    <p>
        <b>Women empowerment</b> refers to making women powerful to make them capable of deciding for themselves.<br>
        <br> Women have suffered a lot through the years at the hands of men. In <b>earlier centuries</b>, they were treated as 
        <br>almost non-existent. As if all the <i>rights belonged to men even something </i>as basic as voting. As the times evolved,
        <br>women d their power. There on began the revolution for women empowerment.As women were not allowed to 
        <br>make decisions for them, <b>women empowerment</b> came in like a breath of fresh air. It made them aware of their
        <br>rights and how they must make their <i>own place in society rather than depending on a man</i>. It recognized the
        <br>fact that things cannot simply work in someones favor because of their gender. However, we still have a long
        <br>way to go when we talk about the <b>reasons why we need it.</b>
